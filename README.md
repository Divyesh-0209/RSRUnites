Project Profile ‒ Definition and Overview

The project titled RSRUnites is a college community posting platform designed to create a shared space for students and administrators of a college or university. It allows registered users to post images and captions that are visible to others once approved by an administrator. The project aims to build a digital community within the institution, enhancing communication and engagement among students and faculty.

The platform has two primary roles: the Admin and the User. Admins handle approvals for join requests, post moderation, and news updates. Users can register, verify their email, post content, and interact with the community after admin approval. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (XAMPP), and MySQL for its implementation.
